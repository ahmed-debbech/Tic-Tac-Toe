# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac toe is a small and simple game that was made for fun.\
**Details:** It was funny for me to program this from scratch, it was made with C and [SDLv1.2](https://www.libsdl.org/). 
## Installation
 1) Download the executable for Windows from [here](http://bit.ly/2Q8bVeP). 
 2) Unzip the file and double click the "TicTacToe2.0.exe".
* IMPORTANT: DO NOT REPLACE, COPY OR DELETE ANYTHING FROM THE FOLDER.
## Contributing
Download this repo and a `make` command will compile the project from source and excute it.
 * IMPORTANT: YOU HAVE TO INSTALL SDLv1.2 LIBRARIES IN ORDER TO RUN THE CODE PROPERLY!\
Pull requests are welcome.
